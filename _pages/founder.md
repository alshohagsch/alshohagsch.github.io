## Early years 

Rahman Mohammad Ataur's parents were uneducated and struggled financially, not understanding the importance of education. As a result, he couldn't afford to go to secondary school. Instead, he worked in the fields after dropping out. Despite his parents' lack of support, he had a strong desire to learn, so he collected old books from friends and taught himself.

When he was 18, he decided to come to Singapore to work as a construction worker to support his family. In Singapore, he could earn S$440 a month, which was a lot more than what he could earn in Bangladesh.

## Life in Singapore

Life was tough when Rahman arrived in Singapore. 

Every day, he worked from 6am to 10pm, and somtimes until midnight. His living conditions were poor, as he stayed in shipping containers without fans or air conditioning. He was also not allowed to practice their religion, as praying and fasting are prohibited by his boss. His overtime pay and working hours were also not properly calculated, leaving him unfairly paid. 

Despite the difficult conditions, Rahman was grateful for the opportunity to work in Singapore and send money back to his family in Bangladesh.


## The Accident

On the day of the accident, Rahman was then assigned to clean a water tank at the Tuas power station. Despite expressing concerns about the darkness and smell inside the tank, his boss insisted that he complete the task immediately or risk losing his job.

While setting up inside the tank with a colleague, there was a sudden explosion when Rahman pushed the switch. Rahman and his colleague were thrown against the wall, and another worker was injured. Rahman suffered severe burns covering 73% of his body.

Despite being conscious, Rahman was weak, extremely thirsty, and unable to communicate properly or recognize his friends. The pain was unbearable, and he prayed for answers and a chance to see his family before passing away.

After a long wait, an ambulance arrived to take Rahman to the hospital. He passed out in the ambulance.

## Recovery

After three months in a coma, Rahman woke up feeling like he was in hell. He underwent physical therapy, enduring pain and various surgeries, including skin grafts, to treat his extensive burns.

He struggled to accept his changed appearance but remained determined to regain a normal life. The hospital staff became like a family to him and offered support.

Once Rahman could talk, he displayed a positive attitude, which earned him the Most Inspirational Patient Award from the hospital.

A social worker introduced him to a non-governmental organization called <a href='https://www.home.org.sg/' target='_blank'>HOME</a>, which provided him with assistance and support. Rahman learned English and computer skills through their programs.

As his recovery progressed, Rahman developed strong bonds with the staff at HOME, who became his friends and offered him the opportunity to help as a translator for other workers.
