Back in 2018, [**Rahman**](/founder/) returned to Atorshova in Pabna, his hometown in Bangladesh from Singapore.

One day, two of his friends turned his attention to the children around his neighborhood that were uneducated. They spent their time working in the field for their family and were as young 5 years old.

As formal education is not a top priority in his village which is reliant on agriculture, his friends suggested to start a school in the village for these kids.

Initially, he did not take the idea seriously. Eventually, he realised that he have been given a new life because he had survived [**the accident**](/founder/#the-accident). He decided that starting a school in his village was what he should do with his new life!

In 2019, he started preparatory work for Al-Shohag School. 

On 1st January 2020, Al-Shohag School started to take in 211 students with 13 teaching staff, full-time and volunteers.
