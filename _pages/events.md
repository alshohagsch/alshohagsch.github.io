Al-Shohag School organises regular school events to celebrate the achievements of the students and to encourage them to learn.

## Sports Day
Al-Shohag School organises a Sports Day every year to encourage students to be physically active and to learn about teamwork. Students can play football, sack race, marbles and other fun sports and games on that day. At the end of the day, the best performing students will be awarded prizes.

## Meet the Parents Day
Al-Shohag School organises a Meet the Parents Day every year to convince the parents to keep their children in school. Unfortunately, the parents do not view their children's formal education as a top priority because the village is reliant on agriculture.
